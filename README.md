- Simple Game making(In various langages but quite simple and lost easily due to the fact I dislike leaving dozens of files on my desktop)
- Web development, mostly practicing making websites one of the major ones being a portfolio I made with it, however dispite me being decent at developing it my color scheme is quite bad along with its off looks(The CSS has a lot of features but it doesnt look good for the fact I'm not a good designer)
